--Middle East/Mesopotamia--

"A donkey with a load of holy books is still a donkey."
                                (Sufi Proverb)

“Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”
"Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."
                                                                  (Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī - 13th cen, CE)
                                                                  


--Rome/Greece--


“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. 
  They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that 
  the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none 
  of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, 
  hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him;
  these are unnatural.” 
“If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.”
                                                               (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations -- 2nd cen. CE)

--East/Zen--


“The wise man is one who, knows, what he does not know.” 
“Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.”
                                                      (Lao Tsu, Tao Teh Ching -- 6th cen. BCE)



**"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous."  (Analects)**
"He who knows all the answers has not been asked all the questions."
"If you make a mistake and do not correct it, this is called a mistake."
“The man who asks a question is a fool for a minute, the man who does not ask is a fool for life.” 
“Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance.” 

                                                        (Confucius - 6th cen. BCE)
                                                        
                                                        
--Modern Philosophy--


"We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us."
                                                                      (Joseph Campbell, American author --20th cen. CE)
